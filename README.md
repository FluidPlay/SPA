# SPA
Python Lobby Server for SpringRTS

SPA is intended as an easy to install and use server for games and mods developed in the SpringRTS engine (www.springrts.com).
It's inspired on SPADS (a well-known and widely-used SpringRTS server), including commands notation and syntax, but it's entirely developed in Python with performance in mind.
